                  Hailing from a small town, I did everything that a boy
                  belonging to a middle-class family from a town does! I used to
                  attend Hindi classes, learn carnatic music, participate in
                  oratorical competition, essay writing, short skits &amp;
                  dramas, and <a  target="_blank"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villu_Paatu">villu
                    pattu </a>(Bow song). Short distances between schools and
                  other extra classes, constantly visiting family friends and
                  relatives (asking questions in grammar or GK to check how good
                  your host's children are!), and a healthy competition ('you
                  know my son is district first last year, how is your son doing
                  in maths') are characteristics of small towns. Academic
                  achievements are on one hand, everybody was expected to do
                  something extra curricular. <br>
                  My dad was a popular senior officer in the postal department
                  and my mom was equally popular as a free-styled tailoring
                  teacher. My sister was active in '<a  target="_blank"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharata_Natyam">Bharat
                    natyam'</a> (classical dance) and no wonder spotlight was
                  hovering around us to keep the pressure on. <br>
                  My first recognized one such instance was when my photo was
                  published in a local newspaper having stood first in the
                  education district. That prompted me to bit more adventurous
                  and took-up 'Computer Science' then buzzword in the academics.
                  Probably, I was part of the first batch computer science
                  student in Tamil Nadu. We learnt BASIC(a), ForTran and bit of
                  hardware. That proved to be a turning point, and here am I, in
                  the world of IT. English teaching community lost one good
                  teacher :-), though I am not able to imagine teaching one
                  subject for all my life. But the teaching passion remains till
                  today. It helped me to travel abroad, deliver presentations
                  and lectures, network with hundreds of people which I am not
                  sure any other industry would have offered. <br>
                  Reading, writing (fiction and technical), delivering training
                  and presentations continue to be my areas of interests.
                  However, what you will write about or deliver presentations
                  on? You need content. That's where the reading habit came
                  handy. My enthusiasm in gathering IT certifications in the
                  early part of my career continued till late and I went on to
                  get myself certified by over 20+ leading IT vendors in about
                  50 products and technologies. And now you know, I 'had'
                  something to talk about!<br>
                  There are lot of things to share about, talk about, let's stay
                  connected! Drop me a mail, if you want to be connected or
                  share your feedback on my works! Thank you for stopping by!<br>

                <h2>What's Mohan Version 4.0</h2>
                <p> If version 1.0 was life in South (studies &amp; parents),
                  version 2.0 was life in North (on my own) and 3.0 was life in
                  the Gulf (all alone). Now version 4.0 (among all) is the
                  challenges I am going to tackle in a new place, new job, new
                  company and new friends &amp; relatives. And the ever
                  energetic, lively and humorous 'Leo' is finding this 4th phase
                  of life absolutely puzzling and exciting altogether! </p>
