                        <p>The ultimate survival guide for anyone caught between the demands of a boss and a spouse.
In the corporate battlefield, your boss demands productivity, loyalty, and your weekends. At home, your spouse expects attention, emotional investment, and flawless memory for anniversaries. You are trapped—expected to excel at work, be present at home, and somehow stay sane in between.
The Tyrant at Work, The Dictator at Home is a sharp, hilarious, and painfully relatable breakdown of modern survival tactics, blending dark humor, strategic insights, and real-world scenarios to help you navigate expectations without losing yourself.
This book explores:
The absurdity of performance reviews—corporate and marital
The art of negotiation—what works with bosses and spouses
How silence is used as punishment in both worlds
WhatsApp survival strategies for avoiding career or relationship disasters
A checklist for selecting the right boss and spouse (if fate allows)
Packed with wit, realism, and battle-tested survival techniques, this book is not just entertainment—it’s therapy for the exhausted middle-class warrior.

If you’ve ever balanced office deadlines with family obligations, endured strategic emotional warfare, or mastered the art of selective suffering, this book will give you one chance to laugh before going back into the chaos again.
Brace yourself—because survival is not just about endurance. It’s about strategy.</p>
